# Lindsey Smith's Professional Portfolio

## Hi, I'm Lindsey
I'm a detail-oriented and efficient developer with a passion for building practical, user-centered solutions. I value authenticity, hard work, and clear communication in everything I do. Whether I’m debugging code, collaborating on new ideas, or learning something new, I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to create tools that make people’s lives easier.

I have experience with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. With a background in Psychology and experience in healthcare and early childhood education, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for people’s needs and challenges. This perspective drives my passion for building technology that’s human-centered, practical, and designed to enhance daily life.
