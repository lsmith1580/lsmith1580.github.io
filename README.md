# Lindsey Smith's Professional Portfolio

## Hi, I'm Lindsey
I'm a detail-oriented and efficient developer with a passion for building practical, user-centered solutions. I value authenticity, hard work, and clear communication in everything I do. Whether I’m debugging code, collaborating on new ideas, or learning something new, I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to create tools that make people’s lives easier.

I have experience with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. With a background in psychology and experience in healthcare and early childhood education, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for people’s needs and challenges. This perspective drives my passion for building technology that’s human-centered, practical, and designed to enhance daily life.

It provides riders with scenic, customizable routes to destinations like the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, prioritizing beautiful landscapes and enjoyable riding experiences over traditional navigation. Built with a clean, user-friendly interface, Scenic Spokes allows users to plan trips, explore route options, and make the journey as rewarding as the destination.
